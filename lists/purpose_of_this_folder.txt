Holy fuck. You can just use `find ./  -printf "%f\n"` to print out every file in a directory, AND all the fucking subdirectories? YES
Anyways, these lists exist for the purpose of advancements. Before, it seemed like quite the task to have just one general-purpose advancement that covers most vehicles.
Now, with find & regular expressions... Shee-yoot. Only reason I'm not doing more advancements is because I don't wanna be like UNU, with advancements for every step of the way.
They're supposed to be like achievements! Not taken literally as to mean every advancement.
