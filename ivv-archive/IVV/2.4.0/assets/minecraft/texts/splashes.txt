You craft a thousand things every day, pal!
You craftin' to me?
You did a good jorb!
You drift well on a flat world, but what about in a city?
You fly well in a flat world, but what about through an elytra course?
You gotta get with it!
You had me at hello!
You have been invited to change the world!
You have to buy one if you wanna get one free!
You matter!
You only wish!
You snoze, you loze!
You too!
You're a pack author, Harry!
You're accepted!
You're going too fast!
You're going too slow!
You're safe with us!
You've got a brand new key!
You've got mail!
Your cube shall be your casket!
Your gender is valid!
Zed's dead, baby...
Zipadeedoodah!
Zoglin!?
