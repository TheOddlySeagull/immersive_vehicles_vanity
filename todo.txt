## Important
FIX CLASSIC TACHOMETER AND MODERN CLOCK!!!

## General to-do
Fully fledged engine customization, turbo on all engines
Trin V4 compatibility
Overhaul accessories system for click-toggles, as seen with catboy parts
Remodel original decor blocks and make new ones
More vehicle noises, both passive and active
Various books, comics, pamphlets, etc. for lore purposes

## Vehicle concepts
Modern Roadster(DMC12) equivalent, should in turn be gasoline-powered instead of electric. Flips concept of gasoline classic and electric revival on its head
Gen V Chevrolet Camaro
Electric van - panel van, camper van, youth
Moped
City bike (Moped but cuter and electric)

## Vehicle basics
Voice lines for more advanced vehicles; KITT/KARR/ACIVE, TDA
Dashboard chime as a part, similar to GGVP
Better and more internal vehicle crafting system; close, needs more parts and vehicle recipes have to be applied afterwards
Remodel legacy vehicles - Helix, Sprinter, Avia, Yatwa, Roadster
Better functionality for probe/port

## Guns
More gun attachments

CANTDO
Regular lift/Gyroscopic lift - World-placed parts won't tow vehicles, may need to make it a vehicle
Anything vaguely resembling an AI for KITT/SSD/Living machines/etc.
