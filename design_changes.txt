Vehicle texture revision (DONE)
Handling rework for the nth time, for more realistic oversteer/understeer
Vehicles protect occupants no matter what in exchange for being unable to attack from inside of vehicles
Vehicle doors stay open when moving, are simply swung around instead of auto-closing (TESTING)
Simpler vehicle style, more closed off model type
