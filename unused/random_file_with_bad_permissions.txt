*Every* MTS pack's got one of these, at one point or another! Check each of their releases.
Seriously, from UNU to Trin, I swear even the freakin OCP had one at some point.
Probably not an issue though since they're always either some file that MTS doesn't use at all, or when it does get pointed to it, MC seems to have no trouble reading it.

Anyways, uhhhh... No, seriously. Why is there always some random file where someone went chmod 444 [filenamehere].[extension]??? WHAT ARE THE MEANING OF THESE?
