# immersive_vehicles_vanity
Immersive Vehicles Vanity (or IVV if you prefer) is an addon pack for Immersive Vehicles that seeks to add comedic value alongside utilitarian vehicles and enticing yet confusing lore to Minecraft.\
This is the repository intended to act as a resource for additional contributor-based content as well as generic backups and a behind-the-scenes view behind nearly every JSON, texture and other tickleable fancies that make up Immersive Vehicles Vanity.

##IMPORTANT!
While there _is_ a `/java/` directory in the main build folder, this is not included in the default CurseForge release for version agnostics and general compatibility.\
However, it is used in an alternate file linked next to the default release in the event that any 1.12.2-specific modpack makers and/or server owners seek additional fancy features such as more involved potion effects and other miscellaneous things.\

Code is generated using Pylo's MCreator found at https://mcreator.net/
\(because I was lazy. deal widdit, it's fun to throw together funky mods in it without using much brainpower or vi/notepad.)
