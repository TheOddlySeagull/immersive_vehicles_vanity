# Immersive Vehicles Laboratories
## AKA International Vista Laboratories
The mysterious ultra-conglomerate to rule them all. Originally founded in 1763 as the Amity Vista House of Research, IVLabs has since branched out from a non-profit research into the world of lifestyle solutions and corporate holdings as part of its worldwide venture, whether by creating new subsidiaries or taking in existing ones.
Rumors have always circulated in regards to the initial founder of IVLabs, especially with whispers of them still impossibly alive and running the corporation to this day.

### - IVL Motor Testing Division
IVLabs began experimenting with the installation of small scale steam engines into (formerly) horse-driven wagons near the tail-end of the 18th century. Among other discoveries, these tests have resulted in the innovations that lead to Minecraft's current-day vehicle market such as reliable motor designs, advances in day-to-day and crash safety, ease of repair and a simultaneously inexpensive-dependable-yet-ethical method for inducing sentience.

## Atlas Motor Productions
A risky attempt by IVLabs to expand itself into the vehicular market which soon proved to be worthwhile, having become the third-largest North American and second-largest worldwide automotive brand in Minecraft.

## Gauss Autoelectric Synergy
Originally founded in the early 1950s as one of the first medium-scale electric automakers, to mixed reception throughout the first half of its lifecycle with a decline throughout the next decade and seeing a brief resurgance during the 1973 oil embargo, during which the company itself, along with the rights to its marketing and patents were bought out by IVLabs. Despite this, Gauss Autoelectric Synergy later faced closure in the late-80s due to a lack of market interest.

## Video and Computing Industries / Video Computer Industries
Founded in the early 20th century as the Tax-Records-Computing Company - focused on records-keeping machines intended for business usage until later expanding into general-purpose calculations computers amidst the second worldwide call to battle. The rising popularity in televisions along with new efficient cost-cutting measures and cutting-edge vacuum tube & transistor technologies lead to TRC choosing to instead specialize in home-video appliances and business mainframes, to which its subsequent rebranding as Video and Computing Industries ensued.

### - Intuit Corporation
Parts production branch of VCI and formerly known as MISE (Microelectronics Intelligence Systems Enterprise), specializing in the design and fabrication of semiconductors. Well known for inventing the first highly-affordable microprocessor known as the 6250-TU, they've since had a hand in general consumer electronics throughout the 1970s to 1990s before rebranding to Intuit. They are now one of the leading producers in consumer processors and have various government contracts for experimental supercomputing.
