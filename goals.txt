Should have a .json item model for nearly every gun by the end of this update (Meme guns can be excluded, barring Pina Colider)
Some more decor blocks would not hurt, low effort with high reward or something like that
Engines should have customizable ECU code, using a bench to modify either an ECU part for older engines, or the engine itself
More gun parts, somehow

That's about it, so that would probably make it a 2.2.0 or something. I dunno.
