OCL-Other crap later

PARTICULARS
Nuclear reactor motor
Buckling Bronco thing, on mental list + model backlog for a while
Gyroscopic lift
Calender
Better tire pressure (Possible TPMS support, otherwise something better than linking height to wheel damage) + switching from built-in MTS popping to custom pop system somehow

MAJOR
Remodel most or all older vehicle models; Mountaineer (source material, '02-05), Sprinter (tough call, may turn it into generic Corolla w/ popups or a Scion tC), Speedback (60s stang), OCL
Rejson a couple of older vehicles; Rock, Speedback, OCL
More gun parts; compensators, non-zoom scopes, bipod + stick-handle-thing grip, lasers/flashlights
Redo posters; credit to artists, more useful posters and a custom poster for pr0n

MINOR
Unique decor blocks (or part decors for advanced function, see particulars)
More interior-vs-exterior sounds
Remodel some decors, nothing in particular comes to mind but I know a couple of them are fuckly as ugg.
