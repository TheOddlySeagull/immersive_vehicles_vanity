Some more decor blocks would not hurt, low effort with high reward or something like that
More items should be in json model form
More interior-vs-exterior sounds
All engines should be, in some manner customizable using the engine bench (Almost finished, torqueline and a couple specific engines left)
More gun parts, somehow (Compensators, non-zoom scopes, bipod part?)
