Some more decor blocks would not hurt, low effort with high reward or something like that
More interior-vs-exterior sounds
Engines should have customizable ECU code, using a bench to modify either an ECU part for older engines, or the engine itself
More gun parts, somehow (Compensators, non-zoom scopes, bipod part?)
