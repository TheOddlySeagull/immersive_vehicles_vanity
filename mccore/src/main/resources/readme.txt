If you can read this, you'd better know what you're doing in here!
We do not take responsibility for game crashes, corrupted worlds, lost items or general misfortune caused by modification of IVV's (or other packs/mods) assets.

However I'm not one of those snooty pack authors who doesn't want you seeing what makes my pack tick. If you find an individual asset or feature that piques your interest, then you are free to take inspiration from, reverse-engineer or outright copy it from this pack.
I hope it sparks some inspiration and leads you to create your own pack, as I believe doing so is the core of community-driven content. If we were to quash that, we'd might as well go back to hard-coding everything into MTS.
Good luck and have fun, bringing today into a bright future!


P.S: By using this pack, you support trans rights. ^v^
