Laura: hey CBC, when you planning on getting back on discord? 1: its hard to communicate with you when youre not really here but i see you active on the github,
so i figured this was the best way to contact you. Wartich wanted to talk with you about some things and i created a group chat, cause he recently saw some features
that you did that hes interested in, and overall, its been quiet without you around.

CBC: In a couple days I think, that just seemed like a good time. I simply needed a break from Discord cause I felt lonely, sorry!
Wartich wants to talk to me? In that case I'll be ready for him then. -cc
